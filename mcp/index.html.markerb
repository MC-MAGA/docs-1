Anthropic [announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) on November 25, 2024, along with a number of [SDKs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sdk/java/mcp-overview) in a variety of languages,
and two types of transports: [stdio and HTTP streaming](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports).

There also is a large list of [existing servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#model-context-protocol-servers) that you can use.

You can deploy servers on your own machine, on fly machines, into containers, or include them in your app.
You can deploy using the Machines API, fly machine commands, or fly launch.
You can access them over the internet or via a private network.
