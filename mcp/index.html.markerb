<div class="important">
Fly.io is a great place to run MCP servers. We also provide an [MCP server](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/mcp-server/) that you can use to provision your application.
</div>

Anthropic [announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) on November 25, 2024, along with a number of [SDKs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sdk/java/mcp-overview) in a variety of languages.
There also is a large list of [existing servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#model-context-protocol-servers) that you can use.

You can deploy MCP servers using three different transport types.
You can deploy MCP servers on [Fly Machines](https://fly.io/docs/machines/), into [containers](https://community.fly.io/t/docker-without-docker-now-with-containers/22903), or include them in your app.
You can deploy using the [Machines API](https://fly.io/docs/machines/api/), [`fly machine`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/machine/) commands, or [`fly launch`](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/launch/).
You can access your deployed MCP servers over the public internet or via a [private network](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/).
